MongoDB 
-Users
    _id: uuid
    userName: String
    password: firebase will handle
    email: String
    posts(images): [id, id, id]
    Location: coordinate obj

-ImagePost
    _id: uuid

Redis
    - redis Set key(Location that we enter placeId + "Nearby"), value (Nearby restaurant) /restaurant/nearby/placeID
    - key (placeID+"Details")  value (res details) /restaurant/id (res details )

Redux/Location
